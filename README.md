## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Open the Guide:** Navigate to the `index.html` file in your browser or visit the live demo link.
2.  **Choose a Category:** Select the primary area where you're experiencing an issue (e.g., "Corners", "Tyres", "Breaks").
3.  **Refine Your Issue:** Based on your first selection, further dropdowns will appear. Continue selecting options that best describe your problem.
4.  **View Solutions:** Once you've drilled down to a specific issue, a list of potential solutions will be displayed. Solutions are categorized for easier understanding (e.g., adjustments to Tyres, Mechanical Grip, Aerodynamics).
5.  **Apply & Test:** Try the suggested setup changes in ACC. Remember to change one thing at a time to understand its effect.
6.  **Reset:** If you want to diagnose a new issue, click the "Look for a new Issue" button.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and animations, creating a modern and responsive user interface.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the interactive logic, dynamic content generation, and handling user selections.


## üß† Core Logic (`index.js`)

The heart of the application lies in the `categories` object within `index.js`. This object defines:
*   The hierarchy of selectable options.
*   The specific issues under each category.
*   The corresponding solutions for each pinpointed issue.

Each key in the `categories` object can either lead to further `options` (another dropdown) or directly to `solutions`. Solutions are themselves objects categorized by setup areas (e.g., `tyres`, `mechanical_grip`, `aero`).

## üí° Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   More detailed explanations for each solution.
*   Ability to filter solutions by car type (if applicable).
*   User accounts to save common issues or preferred solutions.
*   Community-driven suggestions or notes on solutions.
*   Search functionality for issues or solutions.
